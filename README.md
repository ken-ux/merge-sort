# merge-sort

This is an assignment as part of the Odin Project to learn recursive algorithms. The assignment_1.js file has two functions for either iteratively or recursively printing an array of the Fibonacci sequence. The assignment_2.js contains an algorithmic function for performing merge sort on an array.

## Lessons Learned

- Using _.shift()_ to reduce the length of an existing array and fulfill a while loop condition more efficiently than setting a counter.
- Redefining and extending an array by using the spread operator.
